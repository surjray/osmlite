In case of consumer goods, sellers on the Website may or may not specify the retail prices of the items being sold. You are advised to independently verify the retail prices of such items if you so desire.
OSM strongly advises you not to test the site with false bids/purchases, as it will put you at substantial personal legal risk.

Selling
As a registered member, you may list item/s for sale on the Website in accordance with the Listing Policies more fully detailed at eBay Rules and Policies which Policy is incorporated by way of reference in this Agreement. You must be legally able to sell the item(s) you list for sale on our Website. You must ensure that the listed items do not infringe upon the intellectual property, trade secret or other proprietary rights or rights of publicity or privacy rights of third parties. Listings may only include text descriptions, graphics and pictures that describe your item for sale. All listed items must be listed in an appropriate category on the Website. All listed items must be kept in stock for successful fulfillment of sales. All listings must comply with eBay Rules and Policy which Policy is incorporated by way of reference in this Agreement.
The listing description of the item must not be misleading and must describe actual condition of the product. If the item description does not match the actual condition of the item, you agree to refund any amounts that you may have received from the buyer. You agree not to list a single product in multiple quantities across various categories on the site. OSM reserves the right to delete such multiple listings of the same product listed by you in various categories.
If you receive at least one bid at or above your stated minimum price (or in the case of reserve auctions, at or above the Reserve Price i.e. the reserve price as defined by the seller in a reserve auction), you are legally obligated to complete the transaction sale contract with the Winning buyer upon the item's sale online. You must contact the Winning buyer within 72 hours of item selling successfully and supply the item as per the shipping and delivery details mentioned in item description to the Winning buyer in a merchantable condition upon receiving the payment from the Winning buyer and in case of buyer making payments using PaisaPay Facility, upon receiving of payment intimation from PaisaPay Facility in accordance with PaisaPay User Agreement, PaisaPay Seller Terms and Conditions and PaisaPay Rules and Policies, unless there is an exceptional circumstance, such as:
The Winning buyer fails to meet the terms of your listing (such as payment method), or
You cannot authenticate the Winning Buyer's identity provided you have not received any payment from the Winning Buyer. Without limiting any other remedies, OSM may suspend or terminate your account if you are found to have engaged in fraudulent activity in connection with the use of the Website. As sellers on the Website we encourage you to post feedback on the buyer after the auction is closed.
Auction Close
An auction will be considered as successfully closed if it receives at least one bid prior to the Auction End Date i.e. the date and time (as specified in that particular auction) beyond which bids shall not be accepted.

Please note that the contact information that will be sent out will be the information that is provided by the Users in their Registration Data on Website.
Feedback
We encourage buyers and sellers on the Website to provide feedback to each other after the transaction has closed, this helps all Users to know what it is like to deal with the said buyer/seller.

Your feedback will be displayed along with your user ID. OSM will not be responsible for the feedback that you post on the Website and you should be careful about making comments that are not factual in nature and should not post defamatory or illegal or offensive/obscene contents.
You may not take any actions that may undermine the integrity of the feedback system. If you continue to receive negative feedback ratings, OSM reserves the right to suspend your membership, and you will be unable to list, buy or bid on the Website.
Export - You acknowledge that your feedback consists of comments left by other Users and a composite feedback number compiled by OSM, and that the composite number without the comments does not convey your full user profile. As feedback ratings are not designed for any purpose other than for facilitating trading between the Users, you agree that you shall not market or export your Website feedback rating in any venue other than on the Website.
