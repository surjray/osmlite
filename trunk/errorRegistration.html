eBay AG may at any time at its sole discretion reinstate suspended Users. A User that has been indefinitely suspended may not register or attempt to register with eBay AG or use the Website in any manner whatsoever until such time that such User is reinstated by eBay AG. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you breach the User Agreement or the documents it incorporates by reference, eBay AG reserves the right to recover any amounts due and owing by you to eBay AG and to take strict legal action including but not limited to a referral to the appropriate police or other authorities for initiating criminal or other proceedings against you.
Bidding and Buying
All bids (under the Auction format) and all purchases (under the Buy It Now format) on the Website are a firm commitment to purchase. If you are the purchaser/highest bidder for any item and your purchase/ bid is accepted by the seller ("Winning buyer"), you are obligated to complete the transaction with the seller.
An action to purchase or bids may be increased in price or volume later but may not be withdrawn. Purchases/Bids cannot be canceled. By purchasing/bidding on an item you agree to be bound by the conditions of sale included in the item's description (or linked to from the description) so long as those conditions of sale are not in violation of the User Agreement or unlawful. In case of consumer goods, sellers on the Website may or may not specify the retail prices of the items being sold. You are advised to independently verify the retail prices of such items if you so desire.
eBay AG strongly advises you not to test the site with false bids/purchases, as it will put you at substantial personal legal risk. It is an offence to use a false name, other false personal information or a known invalid Credit Card to bid. Willfully entering erroneous or fictitious bids may result in prosecution by eBay AG.
As a Winning buyer you must contact the seller within 72 hours of auction closing successfully.
Please be aware that even if you do not give eBay AG your real name, your Web browser transmits a unique address to us, which can be used by law enforcement officials to identify you.
As buyers on the Website we encourage you to post feedback on the seller after the auction is closed.
In case of purchase of/placing a successful bid for an Artwork which is marked as "non-exportable" on the Website or it is illegal to export the same and you agree that the Artwork shall not be exported out of India or otherwise dealt in any such manner which shall be in contravention of any law for the time being in force or any rules, regulations, notifications and orders passed there under.
Priority in Bidding
In order to qualify and be identified as a successful bid, the following priority parameters will be followed:
Price: The higher price bids always supersedes the lower price bids;
Quantity: Between bids of the same price, the bid for the higher quantity shall supersede;
Time: Between bids of the same price and for the same quantity, the bid which was placed prior in point of time shall supersede. eBay AG's decision on the success or otherwise of a bid shall be final and binding. It reserves the right to reject or void bids, whether winning or not, that it deems not to have been made in good faith, or that are restricted or prohibited.
Buyer Protection Program
The Buyer Protection Program seeks to assist buyers who have been defrauded by sellers on the Website. If a buyer has made a payment for an item and has never received it or has received an item that is significantly lower in value as compared to what was described, the buyer can seek protection under the Buyer Protection Program. The coverage under this program is restricted to Indian Rs. 10,000 per item or the value of the item, whichever is lower.
For this purpose the buyer needs to follow certain steps set out in the Program more fully detailed at http://pages.ebay.in/help/tp/inr-snad-process.html and review the Buyer Protection Eligibility and Claims Process more fully detailed at http://pages.ebay.in/help/tp/esppp-process.html on the Website.

The coverage under this PaisaPay - Buyer Protection Program is restricted to Indian Rs. 50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand only) per item or the value of the item, whichever is lower. A buyer being eligible and seeking protection under PaisaPay - Buyer Protection Program cannot seek any protection for the same transaction under the “Buyer Protection Program” as specified in clause 12 above.
To seek protection under PaisaPay - Buyer Protection Program, the eligible buyer is required to follow and comply with certain steps set out in the Program and review the PaisaPay - Buyer Protection Eligibility and Claims Process on the Website.
Ebay reserves the right to reduce, enhance the maximum amount of protection under this PaisaPay - Buyer Protection Program or may completely discontinue this PaisaPay - Buyer Protection Program, or may modify the terms and conditions, steps and/or process to be complied with by the buyer in order to be eligible and seek protection under PaisaPay - Buyer Protection Program. Any such change and/or modifications shall become effective 30 days from the date of their intimation by Ebay through an electronic communication at the email address provided by users at the time of registration, or as modified and recorded at eBay.
If the seller is found guilty of defrauding the buyer for which eBay AG has reimbursed the buyer, the sellers account on eBay AG shall be blacklisted and eBay AG shall charge the seller with the value of the item and a penalty of 20% of the value of the item. Further eBay AG reserves the right to recover the dues and take strict legal action (including initiating criminal proceedings) against the seller.
Any person who, knowingly and with intent to injure, defraud or deceive, files a Fraudulent Complaint containing false, incomplete, or misleading information may be guilty of a criminal offence and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
