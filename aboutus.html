<p style="margin:50px;">Skynet Corporation is a relatively new company founded in
2008, in Calcutta, India. We at Skynet are untiringly working towards
developing cost effective and simple web applications for the present Internet
&ndash;era, so that the benefits of a connected world goes out to everybody from the
technologically challenged to the hardcore geek. </p>
<p style="clear:left">A brief summary of the products that we have developed so
  far:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Simple games that can be run with simple
  hardware including even a Pentium 1 computer running DOS.</li>
  <li>An online banking solution called OBS that
  delivers banking products and financial services over the internet.</li>
  <li>Our premium offering is the Online Shopping Mall
  or OSM which can be very easily tailored to the needs of any retailer wishing
  to have a web presence.</li>
</ul>  
<p>We are different from our competitors in the very sense of
  simplicity of our products. We always strive to manufacture applications and
  provide services that can be enjoyed by virtually anyone. We offer this
  simplicity at a very low cost. We also strive to use as much free and open
  source software as we can so that we can reuse the components to bring a new
  product faster to the market as well as provide the product at an affordable
  price. And because of the simplicity of design our products are highly scalable
  and extensible. So our products can evolve along with the business of our
  clients.</p>
<p>Our product development team consists of <em>Surjyendu Ray</em>,
  <em>Sandip Shaw</em>, <em>Suvendu Bhattacharyya</em> and <em>Souvik Sett</em>. This team is highly
  innovative and brings new ideas to the market in a competitive package. Our
  dedication more or less compensates for our lack of experience and we are
  gathering invaluable experience as we speak. We always are all ears for our
  customers&rsquo; aspirations and ideas and they form the framework for every venture
  that we step into.</p>
<p>We are proficient in application development for the Web as
  well as business process reengineering for companies who had not have a web
  presence till date. Our world can be visualized at <a

  with a view to making this world a better place for us to live in! </p>
